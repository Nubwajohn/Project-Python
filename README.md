### Project Overview

The data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.

**Data Dictionary**

- order_id: Unique ID of the order
- customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food
- restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant
- cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer
- cost_of_the_order: Cost of the order
- day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)
- rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5
- food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation.
- delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information

### Tools
- Programming Language: Python.
- Data Manipulation & Analysis Libraries: Pandas, NumPy.
- Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tools:Excel, Google Colab.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
**Data Overview**

- Viewing the first rows of the dataset
- Checking the shape of the dataset
- Getting the statistical summary for the variables
- Check for missing values
- Check for duplicates
- Check counts for rating
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis

**Data Overview**

1. Explore all the variables and provide observations on their distributions. (Generally, histograms, boxplots, countplots, etc. are used for univariate exploration.)
2. Which are the top 5 restaurants in terms of the number of orders received?
3. Which is the most popular cuisine on weekends?
4. What percentage of the orders cost more than 20 dollars?
5. What is the mean order delivery time?
6. The company has decided to give 20% discount vouchers to the top 3 most frequent customers. Find the IDs of these customers and the number of orders they placed.
7.  Perform a multivariate analysis to explore relationships between the important variables in the dataset. (It is a good idea to explore relations between numerical variables as well as relations between numerical and categorical variables.
8. The company wants to provide a promotional offer in the advertisement of the restaurants. The condition to get the offer is that the restaurants must have a rating count of more than 50 and the average rating should be greater than 4. Find the restaurants fulfilling the criteria to get the promotional offer.
9. The company charges the restaurant 25% on the orders having cost greater than 20 dollars and 15% on the orders having cost greater than 5 dollars. Find the net revenue generated by the company across all orders.
10. The company wants to analyze the total time required to deliver the food. What percentage of orders take more than 60 minutes to get delivered from the time the order is placed? (The food has to be prepared and then delivered.
11. The company wants to analyze the delivery time of the orders on weekdays and weekends. How does the mean delivery time vary during weekdays and weekends?


### Conclusion and Business Recommendations

#### **Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of the FoodHub data, here are some key conclusions.

1. **Popular Restaurants and Cuisines:**
- Certain restaurants and cuisine types are more popular than others. For instance, Shake Shack restaurants may dominate the number of orders, indicating strong customer preference and high revenue generated.

- Certain cuisines, like American and Chinese, are more frequently ordered, especially during weekends.

2. **Customer Ratings:**
- There is a correlation between the cost of the order and the customer rating; priced meals generally receive better ratings.

- The restaurants with a rating count of more than 50 and an average rating greater than 4 are The Meatball Shop, Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, Shake Shack, and Blue Ribbon Sushi.

3. **Order & Timing:**
- Weekdays have lower order volumes, which still have longer delivery times and slightly lower ratings.

- Most of the orders are made during the weekends with about 71% rather than during the weekdays having about 28%.

- The mean delivery time, respectively, for weekdays is 28 minutes and weekends is 22 minutes.

4. **Revenue:**
- The restaurant with the highest revenue generated is Shake Shack with 3579.53 cost of orders; the lowest is Five Guys Burgers and Fries with 506.47 cost of orders.
  
5. **Food preparation:**
- The lowest food preparation time is Korean, with few outliners indicated.
We can observe that most food prepared averagely above 26 minutes for almost all the cuisine.

#### **Recommendations**

- **Expand Partnerships:** Consider partnering with more restaurants that offer popular cuisine types (e.g., American, Japanese, Italian, Chinese). This will cater to customer preferences and potentially increase order volumes.

- **Optimize Delivery Routes:** Invest in better route optimization technology or AI-driven dispatch systems to reduce delivery times, especially during peak hours on weekends.

- **Reward High Ratings:** Offer rewards or discounts to restaurants that consistently achieve high ratings, incentivizing them to maintain quality service.

- **Pre-order Options:** Introduce a pre-order option for weekends where customers can order in advance, allowing better resource planning for restaurants.

- **Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms:** After identifying trends from customer feedback, work closely with restaurants to address common complaints (e.g., food quality, packaging issues).

 - **Restaurant Efficiency Programs:** Work with partner restaurants to streamline their order preparation processes. This might involve advising on kitchen workflows or even offering incentives for faster preparation times.
